The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a basic JavaScript/Vite project into a feature-rich audit management tool. The initial task involved fixing chart sizing, followed by implementing dynamic chart views (Total Overview, grouped bars by section). Subsequently, automatic recommendations were added, including sample data and a toggle. A critical phase involved refining scoring logic across different scopes (Current Site, Management, All Sites, Project Overview) and ensuring unique question counting. UI/UX was significantly improved by consolidating redundant project/site selectors and introducing a tabbed interface for question management with hierarchical numbering. The latest work focused on making the report generation fully functional, including logo uploads, executive reports, and HTML export, optimized for A4 print. The current task paused while debugging a  during executive report generation.

The initial problem was to fix chart canvas sizing where axes were cut off and charts appeared too large, with responsive design considered. This evolved into enhancing charting capabilities with a Total Overview button for combined management+site data and a grouped bar chart for Performance by Audit Type by sections.
Further requirements included implementing automatic recommendations that weren't appearing, followed by debugging and refining the chart scoring logic for Current Site and Total Overview scopes, distinguishing between site and management questions. The user also requested UI cleanup by consolidating redundant project/site dropdowns and moving project management to System Settings.
Crucially, the System Settings needed to list existing projects, sites, and questions for editing/removal, with proper numbering for questions. A key correction was to ensure unique question counting across multiple sites/projects, avoiding duplication. Management questions logic was refined to be project-based, not site-based, with dynamic dropdowns.
The final major request was to make the report section fully functional, including logo upload, Generate Executive Report, and Export to HTML buttons, with the report layout matching the dashboard, optimized for A4 print with narrow margins, and available for full-screen HTML display for PDF printing.

<current_work>
The immediate task is debugging and fixing the Generate Executive Report functionality. The user reported that the executive report was not generated, and the console showed an Error: An unexpected error occurred undefined and later .

The AI engineer has been actively working on this:
1.  **Investigation**: Examined console logs and .
2.  **Identified Issues**: Pinpointed a potential problem with  access within the report generation process and confirmed the .
3.  **Attempted Fixes**:
    *   Modified  to fix the chart access patterns.
    *   Updated chart capture functions ().
    *   Added better error handling to .
    *   Introduced a simpler test function to debug step-by-step.
4.  **Current Status**: The console logs indicate that data availability, report generation, and chart capture steps are working correctly, and all three charts are successfully captured. However, the  persists, indicating a scoping or definition issue with that specific function in .

The product is in a state where most features are implemented and refined, including advanced chart visualizations, dynamic data scoping, robust question management, and a clean UI. The report generation is the final critical component being made fully operational, with its core structure and other buttons (logo upload, export HTML) already functional. The nuance here is resolving a JavaScript scoping issue for a specific function within the reporting module.
